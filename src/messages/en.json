    "sec1Title": "'Yellow' is much brighter than 'Blue'",
    "sec1Body1": "The 'HSL color space' traditionally used in Web design had a fatal flaw. That is,\n<strong>'Numerical brightness does not match perceived brightness.'</strong>",
    "sec1Body2": "Look at the diagram below. HSL formulas claim that dark blue and bright yellow have the same '50% Lightness'. But clearly, yellow looks dazzling to your eyes, right?",
    "sec1Body3": "'The numbers are correct, but the design looks mismatched.' OKLCH solved this long-standing worry of designers with a biological approach. By incorporating the stimuli received by the retina into the formula, blue and yellow can now be managed with 'correct brightness' as felt by humans.",
    "graphLabel": "▲ Difference in perceived brightness at HSL 'Lightness 50%'.",
    "sec2Label": "02. TWO FACES OF COLOR",
    "sec2Title": "Read by Map or Compass?",
    "sec2Body1": "On this site, we use the terms 'OKLCH' and 'OKLAB' depending on the situation, but they are actually <strong>different representations of the exact same color space</strong>. It is just like the difference between expressing a location on a map by 'latitude and longitude' or 'how many kilometers northeast from here'.",
    "oklabTitle": "OKLAB (Cartesian)",
    "oklabSub": "L=Lightness, a=Green-Red, b=Blue-Yellow",
    "oklabDesc": "Like mathematical XY coordinates. Ideal for calculating 'color distance'. In this diagnosis, OKLAB is active behind the scenes for judging achromatic colors (gray) and calculating closeness between colors.",
    "oklchTitle": "OKLCH (Polar)",
    "oklchSub": "L=Lightness, C=Chroma, H=Hue",
    "oklchDesc": "Like a compass and distance. Suitable for human intuitive operations like 'more vivid' or 'more red'. We use this for displaying diagnosis results and analyzing your preferences on the surface.",
    "sec2Body2": "24bitColors is characterized by balancing calculation 'accuracy' and human 'intuition' by freely moving between these two. especially in handling achromatic colors (black and white), OKLAB is essential for expressing beautiful grays because it can define perfect nothingness as 'a=0, b=0'.",

    "sec1Body2": "So, this system placed <strong>263 'observation points (candidate colors)'</strong> at equal intervals on the entire map called color space. These are like GPS satellites or buoys floating in the sea.",
    "sec1Body3": "Importantly, these 263 colors are not 'answer candidates (choices)'. They are merely <strong>sensors</strong> to sense 'around where' your preference lies. Since the final diagnosis result is calculated by mathematically interpolating (filling) between these points, even colors located where there are no buoys can be identified with near-infinite smoothness.",
    "noteTitle": "Note: Why 263?",
    "noteBody": "Theoretically, more points are placed (496), but as a result of strictly excluding 'areas where colors are crushed' that are visible to the human eye but cannot be reproduced on general monitors (sRGB), these 263 elites survived. If display performance improves around the world in the future, the number of these guideposts is designed to increase automatically.",
    "sec2Label": "02. BAYESIAN INFERENCE",
    "sec2Title": "Clearing the 'Fog of Possibility'",
    "sec2Body1": "The moment diagnosis begins, the system has no idea which color you like. In other words, the 'probability of liking' is spread thin equally for all colors. This is like the entire color space being covered in a 'fog of possibility'.",
    "sec2Body2": "Here, the magic of probability called <strong>'Bayesian Inference'</strong> appears. When you answer 'I like color A', the system calculates 'Checks are high that colors close to A are liked' and 'Checks are high that colors close to B are disliked', and updates the density of the fog (update of posterior probability).",
    "sec2Body3": "Repeating this, the fog that was pure white at first gradually clears, and only one point begins to shine strongly. This is the process of identifying your preference. By taking the approach of 'narrowing down possibilities' rather than 'choosing the correct answer', identification with a small number of questions is made possible.",

    "sec3Body1": "The system does not choose 2 colors properly every time. From thousands of combinations, it calculates and asks the <strong>'Question that yields the most information (High Information Gain)'</strong>.",
    "sec3Body2": "For example, suppose you are asked 'Which do you like, Red or Blue?' and you answer 'Red'. If the system predicted 'You probably like Red' from the beginning, almost no new information is obtained from this question. Conversely, when 'two colors that are completely unpredictable 50-50' are presented, great value (amount of information) is born in your choice.",
    "sec3Body3": "In technical terms, the system avoids <strong>'Questions that maximize entropy (uncertainty)'</strong> and looks for <strong>'Questions that reduce entropy the most'</strong>. If a question comes up where you hesitate like 'I like both...' or 'Both are subtle...', that is proof that the algorithm is approaching your core.
